# React-Sass-Webpack-Template
An empty React / SASS / Webpack Template to get you started with a React project.

# Steps required (on Windows):
1. Download and install node.js from https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Log off and log on, so that the environment variables are applied.
3. Open cmd.
4. Type *npm -v*, to make sure that npm is installed and ready for use.
5. Download this whole Repository, and extract the files.
6. In cmd: Navigate to the downloaded project folder.
7. In cmd, type: *npm install*. This will download the required modules.
8. If no errors occured, the project is ready to run!

Now in cmd, you can choose to either *npm run build*, which will build your project, and put the result in the *build* folder. In that folder there will be an *index.html* which you can open in your browser.
Another, more useful command is *npm run start*, which starts a local development server. After starting, open the website: *localhost:8080*, to view your website. If the cmd window is kept running in this mode, any change you make to the project files will be immediately reflected in the browser.
